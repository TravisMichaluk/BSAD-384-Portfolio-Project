Problem Statement
Food insecurity is a growing issue in Canada, with rising grocery prices making it difficult for individuals and families to afford nutritious meals. The Food Insecurity & Grocery Affordability Tracker aims to analyze food price trends, affordability across regions, and potential solutions. The system will integrate open data sources on grocery prices and inflation trends, allowing users to:
•	Track food price fluctuations over time.
•	Compare grocery affordability by region.
•	Identify budget-friendly food options.
•	Predict future price trends using analytical tools.

Scope:

Tracking food prices from various sources.
Comparing affordability across regions in Canada.
Providing insights into the impact of inflation on food security.
Simulating transaction data for user grocery purchases.
Data Sources:
Canada Open Data Portal (StatsCan): Food price index, inflation reports
Simulated Transaction Data

Assumptions:
All users belong to a specific region that impacts affordability.
Food price data is either sourced from open datasets or simulated for consistency.
Inflation rates and affordability metrics vary by province/region.
Government programs help offset food insecurity, affecting purchasing behavior.
Constraints:
Data availability: Some real-time food price APIs may be unavailable or restricted.
Privacy considerations: User income levels and purchasing behavior need anonymization.
Data freshness: Price and inflation data must be updated regularly to remain accurate.
